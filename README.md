<h1>Gnip Support</h1>
<h2>Example Code Snippets</h2>
<p>This repository contains sample code snippets that demonstrate the basic API methods available on Gnip's API.  These are broken into two categories:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Premium Stream Connection</strong> - Establish a streaming connection to Gnip PowerTrack and Firehose streams, using gzip compression</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Rules API</strong> - Add, Delete, and List rules on PowerTrack Streams</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Search API</strong> - Send requests to Gnip's Search API</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Historical PowerTrack API</strong> - Create and monitor Historical PowerTrack jobs.</li>						
		<li>
			<strong>Rehydration API</strong> - Send requests to Gnip's Rehydration API.</li>			
		<li>
			<strong>Compliance API</strong> - Send requests to Gnip's Compliance API.</li>			
		<li>
			<strong>Data Collector</strong> - Connect to the streaming or polling endpoints, or manage rules on a Data Collector stream.</li>			
	</ul>
</p>
<p>These snippets should serve as an example only for the basic API functions, and do not provide additional functionality that will be crucuial to the success of your application (e.g. reconnect logic, batching rule updates, complying with rate limits, validating rules, retrying failed updates, etc.).</p>
