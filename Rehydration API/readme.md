<h1>Rehydration API</h1>

<p>The Gnip Rehydration API returns full tweet payloads for requested tweet IDs, providing a viable commercial option to turn large volumes of tweet IDs from third-party software vendors into licensed raw Twitter data.  The product supports “rehydrating” tweet IDs from the previous 30 days.</p>
